# Earthquake Android

The below exercise will be used to evaluate your coding style and design decisions:


# Tasks

## Use json earthquake api
Update the Android application to read JSON data from an earthquakes API and populate the list within the main Activity.
Each earthquake will occupy one item in the list.
Please populate the attributes from each earthquake to display.

## Highlight strong earthquakes
If the magnitude of the quake is equal or greater than 8, then distinguish these visually from other earthquakes in the list.

## earthquake details
Tapping an earthquake in the list should open a secondary screen with the location depicted on a map.



# Suggestions

Keep these constraints in mind:
 - Use modern Android development patterns without including 3rd party libraries
 - Write code in Java or Kotlin for Android
 - Do not lock the screen orientation
